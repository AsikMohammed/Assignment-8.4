3.) Difference between Capacity and Fair scheduler

FIFO Scheduler:
    * The FIFO Scheduler places applications in a queue and runs them in the order of submission (first in, first out).
    * Requests for the first application in the queue are allocated first; once its requests have been satisfied, the next application 
      in the queue is served, and so on.
    * The FIFO Scheduler has the merit of being simple to understand and not needing any configuration, but itâ€™s not suitable for shared cluste
    * Large applications will use all the resources in a cluster, so each application has to wait its turn. On a shared cluster, it is 
      better to use the Capacity Scheduler or the Fair Scheduler.

Capacity Scheduler:
    * The Capacity Scheduler is designed to allow sharing a large cluster while giving each organization a minimum capacity guarantee. 
    * With the Capacity Scheduler, a separate dedicated queue allows the small job to start as soon as it is submitted.
    * This is at the cost of overall cluster utilization since the queue capacity is reserved for jobs in that queue.
    * If queues are not designed or used properly, some queues may be overloaded while some may be underutilised.

Fair Scheduler: 
    * Fair scheduling is a method of assigning resources to jobs such that all jobs get, on average, an equal share of resources over time. 
When there is a single job running, that job uses the entire cluster. When other jobs are submitted, tasks slots that free up are 
assigned to the new jobs, so that each job gets roughly the same amount of CPU time.
    * With the Fair Scheduler, there is no need to reserve a set amount of capacity, since it will dynamically balance resources between 
all running jobs.
